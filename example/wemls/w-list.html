      <w-li><w-text-block>Leaving. Vital to the marriage relationship is the leaving behind of the primary
            relationships. The marriage relationship is to supersede that of the parents; in this sense "leaving" one's relationship with one's parents allows one to "cleave" to another. Without this process, there is no firm foundation for marriage.</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>Cleaving: The Hebrew term "dabaq" translated "cleave" comes from a word that means "to stick to, to fasten, to join, to hold onto." As a noun, it can even be used for bracing or soldering (Isa. 41:7). The closeness and strength of the bond illustrates the bond of marriage This same verb, bond, is used to convey the bond between God and His people: "Him shall thou serve, and to Him shall thou cleave and swear by His name" (Deut. 10: 20).</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>Covenanting: In scripture, this pledge, this promise by which married couples are bond together, is<w-page number="176"></w-page> spoken of as "covenant" the word used for most solemn and binding agreement known in God's word (Mail 2:14; Prov. 2:16,17). The relationship between husband and wife is to be patterned after God's everlasting covenant with His people, the church (Eph. 5:21-33). Their commitment to one and another is to take on the faithfulness and endurance that characterize God's covenant (Ps. 89:34; Lam. 3:23). God and the couple's family, friends and community witness the covenant that they make with each other. That covenant is rectified in heaven, "What God has joined together, let not man separate" (Matt. 19:6). Christian couple understands that in marrying. they have covenanted to be faithful to each other for as long as both live</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>Becoming one flesh: The leaving and covenanting to cleave together results in a union that is mysterious. Here is oneness in the full sense the married couple walk together, stand together, and share a deep intimacy. It refers also to the intimate bond of mind and emotions that undergirds this physical side of the relationship.
                <w-list type="ordered" marker="i" start="iv">
                      <w-li><w-text-block>Walking together. Of His relationship with His people God asks, "Can the two walk together, except they be agreed? (Amos 3:3, KJV). That query is appropriate also of those who would become one flesh. God instructed the Israelites not to intermarry with the neighbouring nation,"for they will turn our sons away from following Me, to serve other<w-page number="177"></w-page> gods" (Deut. 7:4 cf. Joshua 23:11-13). When the Israelites ignored this instruction, they met with isastrous consequences (Judges 14-16; 1 Kings 11: 1-10; Ezra 9; 10). Paul reiterated this principle in broad terms of the existence of believers and non-believers. (2Cor.6:14-16; cf. vs. 17, 18). Wilcox (1914) clearly summarizes in his work that Scripture intends that believers should marry only believers. But the principle extends beyond this. True oneness demands agreement as to beliefs and practices. Differences in religious experience lead to differences in lifestyles that can create deep tensions and rifts in marriage. To achieve this oneness, Scripture speaks of people marrying others within their own communion.</w-text-block></w-li>
                      <w-li><w-text-block>Standing together. To become one flesh, the two must be loyal to each other. When one marries, one risks everything and accepts everything that comes with one's m a t e. Marriage requires an active, pursuing love that will never give up.</w-text-block></w-li>
                      <w-li><w-text-block>Trobisch (1971) adds that:<br/>Two persons share everything they have, not only their bodies, not only their material possessions, but also their thinking and feeling, their joy and their suffering, their hopes and their fears, their successes and their failures. 'To become one flesh means two persons become completely one with body, soul and spirit, and yet they remain two different persons. (p. 18).<w-page number="178"></w-page></w-text-block></w-li>
                      <w-li><w-text-block>Intimacy. Becoming one flesh involves sexual union: "Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived" (Gen. 4:1). In their drive to be joined together, a drive that men and women had felt from the days of Adam and Eve, each couple re-enact the first love story.</w-text-block></w-li>

          <w-li><w-text-block>Since the socio-cultural influences that affected the growth of the S.D.A. faith are the issues of the popular 'Sapele water' (ogogoro), wearing of earrings, polygamy, Sunday traditional worship, jewellery and any other cultural millieu which the church frowned at and expected the newly baptized members to stop these habits before being baptized into her membership. On the issue of Polygamy which is an African serious challenge since the entrance of Christianity into Africa, some Christian groups believe that you accept the man and the wives into the church through baptism, other believes that you choose your favourite among your wives and gain baptism into the church. The S.D.A. faith believes you take the first wife and join the church. Then the other wives and kids will be taken care of by the man financially. There must not be sexual intimacy between the man and the other wives other than for the first wife. I recommend that the church should accept all into the church and be admitted into a special class that will enable them to go through biblical lessons that will enable them stop the habits and eventually be baptized. These friends should not hold any church office until they<w-page number="220"></w-page> are geniunely converted by accepting to uphold the S.D.A. beliefs through baptism.</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>According to the belief of the Seventh-day Adventist, the Medical Ministry is the 'right hand' of the gospel. Medical Ministry was one of the opening wedges to the growth of the church in the western, northern and eastern parts of Nigeria by the early missionaries, which has not really been considered in Edo-Delta field, we recommend therefore that the medical mission should be implanted into the approaches that should characterize the evangelical methods of S.D.A. faith in this field.</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>The ministers' welfare as well that rotates around the growth of the S.D.A. faith needs some improvement because the church is financially confined to one pastor to many churches which definitely hinders her growth. I therefore recommend that there should be at least a pastor to one church for the effective management of the church.</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>Based on this biblical examination of becoming one flesh and its principles earlier established according to the S.D.A. girls, it is evident that the girls cannot marry outside the faith. The question comes up again that what then will the girls do? This is so with the fact that the faith or the confidence the Church has is in this principle of marrying within the faith. Do they renounce the S.D.A. faith or become suspended or abandon the Church? The person in question is faced with how to live within this challenge in sharing the gospel of Christ in the Seventh-day Adventist world view to persons outside the faith, and then these suggestions could be considered. Therefore, the belief of the church that there are other people outside the Seventh- day Adventist faith that are not in the fold yet, which<w-page number="221"></w-page> eventually will come in( John 10: 27). If for instance, an Adventist girl or boy finds a partner outside the faith, the girl or boy can share her faith with the fellow. Consequently if the man or the woman agrees to accept the faith genuinely and be a member through baptism, they can marry. This process must not take less than two years. This is to ensure that the person has thoroughly understood the covenant he/she is taking. However, it is discovered that when an S.D.A. is confined to marry within the faith, it does not give the ladies the opportunity to make their choice. More especially when the girls become old and limited to a local church that do not have boys/youngmen of marriageable ages. Based on the church's stand that has not changed, the church encourages S.D.A members marrying within the same faith. It is observed that if they are of the same faith, they will stay in the faith. The youth movement should be strengthened by organizing programs where these issues will be emphasized and outlined.</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>The church should organize special yearly conventions or programs for the singles with the supervision of a group of experienced clergymen. This concept will bring the singles together with the primary objective of making them to choose a partner within the faith to avert experiencing prevalent crisis in marriage in this twenty first Century.</w-text-block></w-li>
          <w-li><w-text-block>The researcher recommends that the Seventh-day Adventist concept of marriage lies between partners of the same denomination. But if any Seventh- day Adventist girl, however, having been taught and counselled insists on marrying any Christian across her denomination, it becomes an ecumenical contact which will<w-page number="222"></w-page> challenge the Seventh-day Adventist's stand on marriage. The researcher strongly affirms White (1952) that marrying outside the faith is forbidden by God, prohibited in the Bible, admonishes to remain unmarried than to commit sin. This is as well the violation of God's clearly revealed will. The researcher however encourages that African Christian should marry within his or her faith.</w-text-block></w-li>
